Data

    Explain where the data was sourced from (e.g., telecom company databases).
    Describe the structure and features of the dataset used for training and evaluation.
    Detail any preprocessing steps undertaken, including cleaning, feature selection, and engineering.

Methodology

    Outline the approach taken to solve the problem of customer churn prediction.
    Discuss why deep learning models (specifically neural networks) were chosen for this task.
    Mention any alternative models considered and reasons for choosing deep learning.

Modeling

    Provide details of the deep learning architecture used (e.g., layers, activations).
